The Math Trainer App is a math learning app that teaches mental arithmetic using levels with different
level of difficulty. The arithmetic works in such a way that you do a task
is asked and has 4 possible answers, one of which is correct (similar to "Who wants to be a millionaire").

Java and Android Studio were used for implementation.
